# Stock Factor Mining Based on Genetic Programming
* Genetic programming is a heuristic formula evolution technique that simulates the process of genetic evolution in nature to generate formulas fitting a specific target. Genetic programming is well-suited for feature engineering and factor mining of factor investing. Since traditional factors are relatively simple technical indicators, genetic programming, enabling the construction of more complex factors, can bring new perspectives to factor mining.  
* This project build a framework for factor mining based on genetic programming and conduct empirical research. Finally, this project also analyze the effectiveness of mined factors based on factor analysis.  
* The framework proposed in this project can be used in factor mining based on genetic programming, creating innovative insights in traditional factor investing.
